Side Scroller GDD 

1. How its going to be integrated. 

- The main Game currently is just a step by step form. you answer questions till you done. at some places there are minigames integrated. 
- I want the side scroller to be the second main part of the game. I want you to always switch between answering qustions and moving forward in the side scroller. 
- The Side Scroller will have Bosses aswell as collectables 
- Those collectables will help in the side scroller itself but also unlock no dialog parts in the "questionaire"
- There will also be things that can be transfered over diffent runs: "Rougelike/ Rougelite"

2. The Game itself 
   
- The SideScroller should look like ASCII Art it doesnt has to be tho.
- I am thinking about a clever approach of combining ASCII and a Canvas.
